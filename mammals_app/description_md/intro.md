# An atlas of mammal traits

Hello, welcome to this shiny app on mammals. 

With this app, you can quickly explore:
- the number of taxa for each taxonomic rank;
- the weight and length range for each order;
- a list of life history traits for each mammal species;
- an estimate of species diet compositon;
- the altitudinal range and biogeographical realm of species.

Data for this app is taken from the COMBINE database (follow this [link](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecy.3344) for the article), and I would like to thank the authors for making the database publicly available.
