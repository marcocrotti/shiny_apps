This is a small shiny app that uses the Pokémon dataset from Kaggle, available here https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/pokemon.

This app has 5 panels:
* **Pokémon stats**: It shows the stats for each pokémon, and compare up to three pokémon in a radar plot.

* **Type vs Stats**: It shows the different stats by type, and compare up to three types up closely.

* **Type effectiveness**: It shows the effectiveness of each type against the chosen pokémon.

* **Pokémon by type**: It shows the number of pokémon by first and second type, for all pokémon and for legendary only.

* **Height & Weight**: It shows an histogram of height and weight (log-transformed) for all pokémon, coloured by type, and highlights the pokémon with highest and lowest values.
